Cycling Aid


SafeCycle is a product that is designed to give cyclists a better riding experience by providing them a navigation system that could increase their safety. Its objective is to eliminate all the visual and auditory distractions from the traditional navigation system such as Google Maps navigation, Apple Map navigation, etc. Instead, SafeCycle provides cyclists a more simple and intuitive way of navigating instructions which are the tactile and simple LED display instructions. SafeCycle is a system that is composed of a Raspberry Pi 4, a Sense Hat module, a pair of vibration motors, a GPS module, and an external power bank.
